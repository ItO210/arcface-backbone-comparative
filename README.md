# ArcFace Backbone Comparative

PyTorch-based research repository focused on comparing lightweight facial recognition backbones under a unified ArcFace training pipeline.
This project is a simplified and modernized adaptation of the original InsightFace implementation, restructured for single-GPU training and PyTorch-only execution, while preserving the original system’s behavior and evaluation methodology.

Developed as part of a research study exploring the performance of lightweight architectures for face recognition. Resulting in the following research paper:

This project was developed in November 2025.
